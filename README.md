  - "Incident response is a hassle" is my motto. That's exactly why I'm passionate about thorough preparation and preventive measures. I firmly believe that 3 days of prevention work is infinitely more valuable than 3 hours of incident response. In the security world, I think "putting in effort to avoid troublesome work" is the highest form of expertise!
